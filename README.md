# ApacheCommonsCLI

This project can be used to find the anagrams of any word with an additional feature of Apache Commons CLI. I have added 4 options for the same which are as follows
-h for help
-a to provide a word for the anagram
-words to find all the anagrams of the word
-nf to find the anagrams of the word which are in a data file
